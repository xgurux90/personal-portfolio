            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a highly experienced Sales Manager and <strong>Certified Fire Protection Specialist (CFPS®)</strong> with more than twelve years of experience across the industrial, fire protection, automation and energy sectors. Originally trained as a mechatronics engineer, I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics, Robotics and Automation from Al‑Balqa Applied University (2008&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;2012), giving me a solid technical foundation on which to build client‑focused solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career I’ve progressed from engineering roles in production and fire safety to senior sales and leadership positions. Today I manage sales operations for regional automation and fire protection markets while guiding multidisciplinary teams and nurturing long‑term client relationships. Outside of work I'm based in Dammam, Saudi Arabia and enjoy spending time with my wife and two children, Judy and Omar.
